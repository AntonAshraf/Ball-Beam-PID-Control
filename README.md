# Ball & Beam PID Control System using Arduino Uno

## üìÑDescription:
This GitHub repository contains a project for an Automatic Control System course implementing a Ball and beam control system using Arduino Uno, a servo motor, an ultrasonic sensor, and a breadboard setup. The system employs a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller to maintain the position of a ball on a beam.

## üöÄFeatures:

- Arduino Uno-based control system for a Ball & Beam setup
- PID controller implementation for maintaining ball position
- Utilizes a servo motor for beam movement
- Incorporates an ultrasonic sensor for ball position detection
- Designed on a breadboard setup for easy replication and experimentation

The code and schematics provided serve as a learning resource and practical implementation of control system concepts, demonstrating PID control in a real-time physical system.
